What is a Decision Tree?
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning model that works like a flowchart or a tree structure to make decisions based on input data. It splits data into branches based on feature values, leading to decisions (leaf nodes) at the end.

Each node represents a feature (e.g., Rank, Age).

Each branch represents a decision rule (e.g., Rank <= 6.5).

Each leaf represents an outcome (e.g., Go = YES or NO).

The tree is built by selecting the best feature splits that separate the data into groups with similar outcomes, using criteria like the Gini impurity to measure the quality of splits.

How the Code Works
Data Preparation: Converts categorical data (Nationality and Go) into numeric values because decision trees require numeric inputs.

Feature Selection: Uses columns like Age, Experience, Rank, and Nationality as inputs to predict the target variable 'Go'.

Model Training: Fits a decision tree classifier on the data, learning decision rules from the features.

Visualization: Plots the decision tree showing how decisions are made at each node.

Prediction: Uses the trained tree to predict whether the person would go to a comedy show given new comedian features.

Additional Notes on Decision Trees
The Gini impurity measures how mixed the classes are in a node; lower values mean purer splits.

Decision trees can sometimes overfit the training data if too deep.

Predictions are probabilistic and can vary slightly if the tree is re-trained.

Decision trees are intuitive and easy to visualize, making them useful for explaining decisions.
